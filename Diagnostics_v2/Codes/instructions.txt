Process: raw data -> cropping and rotating -> converting to dose -> converting to spectrum

- Put all raw data and stack details into Data folder.
- Use RCF_Image_Crop.py to just crop and rotate images and export them as needed.
- Use RCF_Dose.py to convert all stack layers into dose pictures.
- Use RCF_Deposition_Curves.py to determine the protons of which energy deposit into which layer.
- Use RCF_Proton_Spectrum.py to find the spectrum and temperature of protons.
